Timeseries Multivariant Forecasting with LSTM model
The notebook focuses on time series forecasting of electricity load data provided in the Train.csv file. The fluctuations in electricity load are influenced by various factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.

Our approach involves training an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model using hourly records spanning from 2015 to 2019. Subsequently, we will utilize this trained model to predict the demand for January 2020. We'll then assess the model's performance by comparing its predictions with the actual load data.

Let's dive into building and evaluating the LSTM model for multivariate time series forecasting.
